## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

On this project, I learned a lot. Using flexbox before was quite difficult as I didn't really understand the concept, but facing many problems with my CSS file, I had to challenge myself to find a way out, and I did it !
So I'm grateful having taken this project, it helped me improve my skills and more important, my understanding.
I'll defitinitely take another project to learn.
Also feel free to give any advice if you have some !

### Continued development

I plan to focus on training my Html/CSS skills, and starting to learn JavaScript in few days.
I will use projects on FrontendMentor first, to face numerous challenges. It will allow me to grow slowly but firmly.
Later, I will focus on learning Python as the possibilies it offers are huge, since I'm interested in Data, AI, and web development.


### Useful resources

- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helped me when I had trouble with CSS. It's really useful to find any answers.
- [Flexbox Cheatsheet](https://flexbox.malven.co/) - This is an amazing website which helped me finally understand how to handle flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
